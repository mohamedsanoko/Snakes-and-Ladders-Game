# Snakes-and-Ladders-Game
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game, Snake and Ladder, using Java 
programming language. The game is designed to be played by two players on a board with 100 
squares, and the objective is to reach the last square before your opponent does. The game
features both snakes, which can send the player back to a lower square, and ladders, which 
can propel the player to a high square. The game can be played in console mode and 
includes a simple user interface to input player names and to display the board after each
turn.
